# Beam Plays the Sega Collection

Sega released a ton of Mega Drive/Genesis games into packs onto steam that are wrapped up into a nice official emulator.

Owning at least one game from the collection is **REQUIRED**. I reccomend [Streets of Rage 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/71165/)

There's also packs that include multiple games you can find the [packs on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=SEGA%20MEGA%20Drive%20Classics%20Pack) +
[Pack 5](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/14445/) (Not included in my search results for some reason).

There's also a [bundle](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/7827/) for a load of them which is what I purchased awhile ago. 

## Setup
I'll be aiming to make this simpler at a later date. Contact me on twitter if you need help:

1. Get yourself [Nodejs](http://Nodejs.org) and Java
2. Download this project as a zip file
3. Unzip it.
4. Open a terminal/cmd in its folder
5. Enter npm install. This will install project dependancies
6. Write a config file in config/ called default.json follow the sample one for a guide.
7. Open up the Sega Collection via steam and click options.

I've set this up to use the top row of the keyboard 1 - =. This keeps things like WSAD free for YOU to use if you don't have a controller. I'm also limited by the choice of keys that the underlying nodejs module that pushes keyboard keys for you can use.

The end goal is to emulate a HID device and ouput button pushes so we don't have to use your keyboard but until then. Pause interactive mode if you need to type.

### For One player games (Beam Plays):
Setup the 1st player to be custom keyboard

Click assign controller mapping and set it up like this:

![One player controls][controls]

### For Two Player Games (Play *With* Beam)

Setup Player one however you like.

Set player two to custom keyboard:

Click assign controller mapping and set it up like this:

### Notes
X,Y and Z don't really matter here only a small amount of Mega Drive games used them and to the best of my knowledge they aren't included in the packs on steam.

Please remember what start is too as I neglected to give viewers that particular control to prevent "Pause Spam" whilst I workout kinks in how I handle data from Beam. You may have to for some games push start for the viewers. Every other control works fine though.

## Use

1. Launch the sega collection and pick a game, Wait till you get to the games main menu.
2. Set Beam to Interactive mode etc. (TODO: Once site is live)
3. Run the program with `node index.js` or your Operating system's equivelant. 
4. If you see "Connected to beam" your all good and can start playing.
5. If you see any messages or errors your setup may be incomplete or your config file may be missing or missconfigured. Refer to the example config file to see how one should be layed out.
6. Leave the window open and it'll report button state changes.

##Games Tested
Ive tested these with low numbers of viewers:
* Gunstar Heroes(The whole reason this project exists)
* Streets of Rage 2. There's a duel mode here where you can fight each other too!
* Streets of Rage.
* Ecco The Dolphin

## TODO
* Wire up X Y Z just for the sake of having control pad completeness
* Adjust code to handle and ignore users who are spamming pause.
* Somehow emulate a HID device and move this OFF the keyboard.
* Test more games
